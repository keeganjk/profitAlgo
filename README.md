## What is it? <a id="what-is-it">
profitAlgo is an algorithm that converts a <b>profi</b>ciency-based grade (a grade from 1 to 4) into a percentage.
### Why? <a id="why">
My high school has started to use proficiency-based grades instead of percentages. I've used percentage/letter grades my whole life. Myself and others feel that percentages are better than proficiency-based grades for many reasons, one of them being because only having 4 grades is too broad and doesn't make as much sense as percentages/letters.
